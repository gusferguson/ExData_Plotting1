## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The data is described in the codebook: [Codebook.md]

For each plot:

###Plot 1:
R code file: [plot1.R](plot1.R)

Plot image: [plot1.png](plot1.png)

###Plot 2:
R code file: [plot2.R](plot2.R)

Plot image: [plot2.png](plot2.png)

###Plot 3:
R code file: [plot3.R](plot3.R)

Plot image: [plot3.png](plot3.png)

###Plot 4:
R code file: [plot4.R](plot4.R)

Plot image: [plot4.png](plot4.png)

PNG files are all 480 x 480 px.* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
